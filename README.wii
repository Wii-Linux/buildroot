Notes for Wii builds:

- `sdk.config`, run `make sdk` with this and move it into "sdk/wii-linux.tar.gz"
- `in-kernel-ramfs.config`, used to generate `initrd-src`.
- `installer.config`, used to generate `installer-src`.
- `loader-bin-config`, used to generate `loader-img-src`.

These will be cleaned up eventually, but for now, they are as they are.
These are truly awful, and I wish mercy on your soul if you actually try to bootstrap your own system with these.
Good luck.
